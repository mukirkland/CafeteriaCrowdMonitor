## Personal Note

__Shanghai Pinghe School owns the sh**ttest cafeteria in this world.__ I often found myself running down from the fourth floor, only to be greeted by a 20-minute queue in the cafeteria. I found this situation unbearable and decided to create this solution to help both students and teachers better manage their time during peak meal hours. I hope this project can alleviate the congestion and make the dining experience more enjoyable for everyone at our school. __But still, Shanghai Pinghe School owns the shittest cafeteria in this world.__

A special shoutout to my fellow alumni and current studentsâ€”let's keep making our school cafeteria a better pile of shit.
